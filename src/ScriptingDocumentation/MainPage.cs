/// @mainpage Introduction
/// GeoGen Script is the language used to write map scripts for GeoGen. It is high level dynamically typed procedural programming language.
/// 
/// The language's syntax is inspired by modern programming languages such as C# and Java, but its function is more similar to PHP and JavaScript. The Squirrel programming language was also significant influence, because it was used as primary scripting language in previous version of GeoGen. However, GGS is much simpler language than either of these, because it forgoes more advanced features such as custom classes and inheritance.
