TODO:
	Core:
		- GCC Unicode support
		- finish the 2D::CreateRiver function (underway in a separate branch)
		- get rid of SqPlus (or at least replace it with better binder)
		- add 2D::StrokePath
		- add 2D::Turbulence
	GGENNET:
		- System.ComponentModel.EditorBrowsable
	STUDIO:
		- add overlay and map previews to overlay and map selection boxes
		- printing in Studio
		- open files directly from system shell (via file associations)
TOFIX:
	CORE:
		- TEMPORARILY FIXED: objects that are not manually relased in the script won't be deleted at all (bug most likely caused by SqPlus,
		  getting rid of it should fix it, the only other solution might be manual instance tracking)
		- optimize 2D::VoronoiNoise (point sets can be reused for consecutive cells)
		- 2D::FillPolygon fails if the Y coordinate of topmost point is < 0
		- only 32bpp RGBA color depth is supported for overlays
	STUDIO: 
		- heightmap/texture import silently fails for overly big images (=> warning box should be shown)		
		- crash if another map is generated while a model is being built for previous one
		- only 32bpp RGBA color depth is supported for overlays and imported heightmaps
		- surface normals are not scaled propertly when height scale changes (resulting in unstable light strength)
		- weird crash after Settings->OK if a 3D map is already displayed
