TODO:
	Core:
		- GCC Unicode support
		- get rid of SqPlus (or at least replace it with better binder)	
	STUDIO:
		- add overlay and map previews to overlay and map selection boxes
		- printing in Studio
TOFIX:
	CORE:
		- TEMPORARILY FIXED: objects that are not manually relased in the script won't be deleted at all (bug most likely caused by SqPlus,
		  getting rid of it should fix it, the only other solution might be manual instance tracking)
		- optimize 2D::VoronoiNoise (point sets can be reused for consecutive cells)
		- add presets documentation	
	STUDIO: 
		- surface normals are not scaled propertly when height scale changes (resulting in unstable light strength)
		- studio asks for external texture each time map is regenerated
		- squirrel std functions are missing from the code completion list
